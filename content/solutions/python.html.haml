  Unlike compiled languages, Python doesn't need a "build" per se. Python
  projects can still benefit greatly from using Jenkins for continuous
  integration and delivery.

  In the Python ecosystem there are tools which can be integrated into Jenkins
  for testing/reporting such as:
  
  * [nose2](https://github.com/nose-devs/nose2) for executing unit tests and
    generating JUnit-compatible XML test reports _and_
    [Cobertura](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Cobertura+Plugin)-compatible
    code coverage reports.

  * [pylint](http://www.pylint.org/) for generating code quality reports which
    can be integrated directly into Jenkins for trending and reporting purposes.
