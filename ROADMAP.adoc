= jenkins.io roadmap

This document is the home of the roadmap for moving from the "legacy" site on link:https://jenkins-ci.org[jenkins-ci.org]
to the new and improved, super amazing, link:https://jenkins.io[jenkins.io]


== Static Site switchover

1. properly import non-story (see standalone) pages from Drupal (link:https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/WEBSITE-34[WEBSITE-34])
1. import legacy site (*on-going until full cut-off*)
1. determine where we can generate the site (link:https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/WEBSITE-35[WEBSITE-35])
1. determine how we're going to host (link:https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/WEBSITE-38[WEBSITE-38])
1. deploy the new statically generated site to link:http://beta.jenkins-ci.org[beta.jenkins-ci.org]
1. cut over from Drupal to the statically generated site

== Development of new site

Developing the new site should, ideally occur in the same branch as the static legacy site. This will help ensure that,
while we might not incrementally change over to the new site, the raw content can be generated for both legacy and new
structures for the site.

=== Creating the new "look"

Here's a quick sketch of what I (link:https://github.com/rtyler[rtyler]) think we should be doing for creating the
new look for the `jenkins.io` site:

1. make sure the content types are clear on what's needed (see link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins.io/pulls/2[pull request #2])
1. link:https://github.com/gusreiber[gusreiber] ponders and makes some wireframes that we can talk about with the community
1. link:https://github.com/rtyler[rtyler] posts and organizers a feedback cycle with the community
1. if everything works out, we arrive at a decision for a set of wireframes that make sense and link:https://github.com/gusreiber[gusreiber] implements some templates (ideally in link:http://haml.info[haml]) for those
1. link:https://github.com/rtyler[rtyler] ties everything together and starts building out craptons of content


=== Beta site
